        // the idea is the have all info on in one question
        // hopefully I will be able to use Math.Rand to give only one piece of information and the rest has to be deduced.
        // I would also like to be able to keep track of how many element were gotten completely correct and how many had some wrong info
// required info:
// element name
// abbreviated element name/symbol
// periodic number
// molecular mass
// number of neutrons (this will not be one of the available infos to get)
