  Purpose: Travel Tickets Company sells tickets for airlines, tours, and other travel-related
services. Because ticket agents frequently mistype long ticket numbers, Travel Tickets
has asked you to write an application that indicates invalid ticket number entries.
The class prompts a ticket agent to enter a six-digit ticket number. Ticket numbers
are designed so that if you drop the last digit of the number, then divide the number
by 7, the remainder of the division will be identical to the last dropped digit. This
process is illustrated in the following example:
 *
 * Step 1 Enter the ticket number; for example, 123454.
Step 2 Remove the last digit, leaving 12345.
Step 3 Determine the remainder when the ticket number is divided by 7. In this case, 12345 divided
by 7 leaves a remainder of 4.
Step 4 Assign the Boolean value of the comparison between the remainder and the digit dropped
from the ticket number.
Step 5 Display the result�true or false�in a message box.
 *
 *
 * Accept the ticket number from the agent and verify whether it is a valid number.
Test the application with the following ticket numbers:
l 123454; the comparison should evaluate to true
l 147103; the comparison should evaluate to true
l 154123; the comparison should evaluate to false
Save the program as TicketNumber.java.
