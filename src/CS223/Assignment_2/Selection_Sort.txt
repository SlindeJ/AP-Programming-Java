I estimate that selection sort would take about ~10,000,000ms to sort 1 million unsorted names, and I think it would take ~20ms is the names were sorted. I decided on
the time for the unsorted list because it looked similar to insertion sort in the trend of increasing time. 1k -> 10k is ~10x longer, 10k -> 100k is ~100x longer.
Estimating a time for the sorted names was harder. I came up with ~20ms because I believe that going through all that data will take a lot of time, but selection sort seems to
go through it almost instantly.
